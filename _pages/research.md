[Heterogeneous Asset Returns and Monetary Policy Redistribution](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/Heterogeneous_Asset_Returns_and_Monetary_Policy_Redistribution.pdf)
> My research investigates the effects of monetary policy on wealth inequality and shortterm consumption dynamics due to changes in the federal funds rate. In this economy,
housing and equity earn different rates of return while households exhibit heterogeneous
marginal propensities to consume from their income, resulting in varying monetary policy impacts across the net wealth distribution. I find that a 1% decrease in the federal
funds rate leads to a 1.63% increase in aggregate consumption, with an asymmetric effect: a 1% rate hike reduces consumption by only 1.02% , indicating potential challenges
in achieving a ’soft landing.’ Moreover, I examine the interplay between borrowing
constraints and return variations based on housing tenure and age, revealing distinct
group exposures to monetary policy shifts and identifying winners and losers. For
instance, I quantify an aggregate redistribution effect, yielding a 3.02% consumption
increase for outright homeowners and a 1.43% increase for mortgage holders following
a 1% federal funds rate decrease. Additionally, middle-aged individuals experience a
1.57% consumption increase, while young individuals see a 1.29% increase under similar conditions. Notably, these effects exhibit pronounced asymmetry.

Portfolio Choices, Asset Prices, and Wealth Inequality (with Yu-chin Chen and Brian Greaney)
> The escalation in wealth inequality over recent decades underscores a substantial societal challenge, manifesting across both generational and racial divides. Notably, a stark disparity exists between the average wealth of households aged 20-39 and those aged 60 and above from the 1960s to 2019. Our investigation seeks to unearth the underlying mechanisms driving this trend, with a spotlight on changing asset returns as a pivotal contributor to burgeoning inequality. We meticulously explore three potential sources of disparity across birth cohorts and race: the vicissitudes of asset markets, varying levels of inheritance and debt at the outset of working life, and barriers to investment such as the costs associated with homeownership. Employing a dynamic heterogeneous-agent model, we delve into households' lifetime financial decisions, meticulously calibrating our model with the data from the Survey of Consumer Finances to scrutinize how asset returns, initial wealth, and investment opportunities collectively fuel the observed inequality trends. Our analytical journey extends to assessing the welfare effects and evaluating potential policy reforms to mitigate these entrenched disparities, aiming for a more equitable economic landscape.


[Choice of Refinancing and Hand-to-mouth Status](https://rdatta2-code.github.io/files/Choice_of_Refinancing_and_Hand_to_mouth_Status.pdf)
> What does the choice of refinancing reveal about the Hand-to-mouth (HtM) status of households? Preliminary empirical analysis from the SCF corroborates the interlinkage between household debt & HtM status. Further evidence from refinance approvals indicate strong demand for home equity extraction in periods of high unemployment often aided by higher house prices. Following Kaplan, Violante and Weidner (2014), I motivate their measurement by setting up a 3 period partial equilibrium model with heterogeneous preferences to investigate the importance of considering mortgages distinctly from other illiquid assets in the determination of HtM status. Better estimates of the same is imperative for understanding the transmission and redistributive effects of monetary policy & fiscal transfers. Simple qualitative experiments in a calibrated model strongly match the current trends in house prices, unemployment and mortgage refinancing.

[IMF Trade Flow Forecasts for Crisis Countries: (In)Accuracies and Their Origins](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169207022001042?dgcid=coauthor) <!--[[slides](https://econreinakawai.github.io/files/IMF Nowcasts_slides.pdf)]-->

<!--
> External sector surveillance and stabilization are core missions of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since 1992, the IMF approved over 600 crisis country loan programs, conditional on reforms and performance targets that are contingent on IMF crisis assessments and recovery forecasts. The literature evaluating IMF crisis forecasts has primarily focused on GDP, inflation, and fiscal budgets, but IMF programs often originate with balance of payments crises. Our evaluation of IMF imports/exports/exchange rates in crisis countries reveals a surprising dichotomy: import forecasts are largely efficient and unbiased, while exports and exchange rate forecasts exhibit substantial biases and inefficiencies. We show forecast errors in the full sample are driven by deeply flawed IMF forecasts for LICs in crisis. Fixed exchange rate LICs (predominantly African franc zone countries) receive systematically inefficient import forecasts. Exchange rate forecasts for LICs with flexible exchange rates are so inefficient, they cannot outperform a naive random walk, and over 30 percent of the forecasts cannot match the exchange rate’s directional movement during the first year of the recovery. Examining the sources of biases and inefficiencies, we highlight effects of conditionality and geopolitics that were not fully accounted for in IMF forecasts, specifically those relating to arrears (domestic and foreign), fiscal finance (balance and credit limits), policy reforms (trade and government), (civil) wars, and elections.-->

[Public Debt and Real GDP: Revisiting the Impact](https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2022/04/29/Public-Debt-and-Real-GDP-Revisiting-the-Impact-517449)
(with Constance de Soyres and Mengxue Wang)<br/>
**_IMF WP Number: 2022/076_**
> This paper provides new empirical evidence of the impact of an unanticipated change in public debt on real GDP. Using public debt forecast errors, we identify exogenous changes in public debt to assess the impact of a change in the debt to GDP ratio on real GDP. By analyzing data on gross public debt for 178 countries over 1995-2020, we find that the impact of an unanticipated increase in public debt on the real GDP level is generally negative and varies depending on other fundamental characteristics. Specifically, an unanticipated increase in the public debt to GDP ratio hurts real GDP level for countries that have (i) a high initial debt level or (ii) a rising debt trajectory over the five preceding years. On the contrary, an unanticipated increase in public debt boosts real GDP for countries that have (iii) a low-income level or (iv) completed the HIPC debt relief initiative. -->
